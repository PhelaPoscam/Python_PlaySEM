## 🐛 Recent Bug Fixes

### Fixed Today

1. **RuntimeError: no running event loop** ✅
   - **Issue**: GUI crashed when trying to connect
   - **Cause**: Qt main thread had no asyncio event loop
   - **Fix**: Integrated qasync library for proper async/Qt integration
   - **Commit**: `3221bb8`

2. **HTTP Protocol 404 Error** ✅
   - **Issue**: HTTP connection failed with "HTTP server returned 404"
   - **Cause**: Endpoint was `/api/devices`, not `/api`
   - **Fix**: Updated HTTP protocol to correct endpoint
   - **Commit**: `ea51aa7`

3. **Event Loop Mismatch on Close** ✅
   - **Issue**: "Task got Future attached to a different loop" on window close
   - **Cause**: Tried to use blocking asyncio calls from different event loop
   - **Fix**: Simplified to non-blocking async task scheduling
   - **Commit**: `ea51aa7`

4. **Thread Safety Issues** ✅
   - **Issue**: "QObject::setParent in different thread" errors
   - **Cause**: Manual AsyncWorker threads with different event loops
   - **Fix**: Removed threading, use qasync native support
   - **Commit**: `3221bb8`

## 🆕 New Features (Today)

### MQTT Protocol with Auto-Start ✅

**What's New**:
- Complete MQTT protocol implementation (`gui/protocols/mqtt_protocol.py`)
- Auto-start mechanism for backend MQTT broker via WebSocket
- 5-retry connection logic with exponential backoff
- MQTT connection panel in GUI with host/port/auth settings
- Integrated with ProtocolFactory for seamless switching

**How It Works**:
1. User selects MQTT protocol in Connection Panel
2. Clicks "Connect"
3. GUI sends WebSocket command to backend: `start_protocol_server`
4. Backend starts embedded MQTT broker on 127.0.0.1:1883
5. GUI connects directly to MQTT broker
6. Connection succeeds with automatic retry on timing issues

**Documentation**:
- See [`development/PROTOCOL_TESTING.md`](./development/PROTOCOL_TESTING.md) → "GUI MQTT Connection (Auto-Start Feature)"
- See [`development/PROTOCOL_FIXES.md`](./development/PROTOCOL_FIXES.md) → "✅ 4. GUI MQTT Auto-Start"
- See [`reference/architecture.md`](./reference/architecture.md) → "MQTT Auto-Start Architecture"

**Testing Ready**:
```bash
# Terminal 1: Backend
python tools/test_server/main.py

# Terminal 2: GUI  
python -m gui.app

# GUI: Select MQTT → Click Connect → Should work!
```

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Event Loop Integration

```
PyQt6 Application
        ↓
QEventLoop (from qasync)
        ↓
asyncio event loop
        ↓
@asyncSlot decorated methods
        ↓
Async operations (WebSocket, HTTP)
        ↓
UI updates via Qt signals
```

**Key Point**: Single integrated event loop - everything runs in Qt's event loop

### Protocol Layer

```
AppController
        ↓
BaseProtocol (abstract)
        ├── WebSocketProtocol
        └── HTTPProtocol
        ↓
Backend Server (FastAPI)
```

### Data Flow

```
User Action (click button)
        ↓
@asyncSlot handler
        ↓
Async controller method
        ↓
Protocol send/receive
        ↓
Qt signal emitted
        ↓
UI callback executed
        ↓
Status bar updates
